**jQuery Validatable** is a jQuery plugin for complex form validation. It provides a lightweight framework for interacting with forms and is aimed at front-end developers. It's designed to work with Bootstrap markup, mainly due to making use of has-success and has-error classes for validation states.

See [online manual](http://progpis.github.io/jquery-validatable) for details.
